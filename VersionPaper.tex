\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Data Corpus}

\par To answer our research questions we gathered information about version numbering from both open source and proprietary projects, totaling  \TotalNumProjects projects. When selecting projects to add to the corpus we chose
projects that are (i) mature and well-known, and (ii) representative. Our corpus spans the areas of software development tools, operating systems, games, programming languages, desktop applications, productivity tools, libraries and frameworks, etc. 
Our requirements for members of the corpus also included easily accessible version information as well as adequate documentation.

For open source projects we drew data from both Github and SourceForge because previous studies \cite{} have shown that git and svn, the backbone of Github and SourceForge respectively, are the most widely used version control systems. In addition to this, both systems contain rich history information about tags and version numbers. To retrieve the version history of each project we used the \code{git tag} and \code{svn list} 
%svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/\$project\_name/code/tags}  
commands and stored the output of each command for later analysis.

For proprietary projects, sometimes the version numbers from the producer website
were incomplete or disorganized. Thus we recovered the missing information from third party websites.
To extract version numbers, we combined information from readily available producer sources such as release notes, documentation, and download archives
with information from third party websites such as wikis, user forums, press releases.
When we had to use multiple sources, we merged the version numbers into a single set per project. During the merge we removed duplicates between the documents, but did not remove duplicates when they existed in the same document, e.g., when two different download archives had the same version number.

Table \ref{tab:ProjectsCorpus} lists the names of the projects in our corpus. For each project we also tabulate information such as age, size, number of versions, \TODO{describe the columns}.

\subsection{Data Parsing}

 Version numbering patterns can vary widely between projects, thus making comparison difficult. 
To counter this, we defined common patterns across different numbering approaches. 

We defined a version number as a composition of the following parts: 
prefix, first version compound, second
 version compound, third version compound, fourth version compound, suffix label, and suffix number. 

Additionally, our definition discards delimiters (e.g., period, underscore, space, dash). When the version number contains textual compounds (e.g., \code{a}, \code{b}, \code{c}) we convert them into a numerical representation such that we can compute metrics even for such compounds. 

Table \ref{table:exampleVCs} shows examples of version numbers before-and-after 
our parsing.

\end{tabular}

\end{table*}
 
 
 
 To process and analyze the collected version number data we wrote a script that parses the data into our format.

% In order to ensure that we covered most common patterns of version numbering that appear in the dataset, we created a test suite with common parsing scenarios (TODO: do we need to list common scenarios? ). Test cases can be found in github repository [LINK] of our project.

%\par Different projects use different version numbering practices. 
%In order to standardize version numbering patterns to be able to parse corresponding versions that appear in different data sources, we have come up with a convention for version number structure. 
%Convention includes following parts of version number: prefix, first version compound, second version compound, third version compound, fourth version compound, suffix label, suffix number. 
%Script that parses version numbers allows for following separators between different version number compounds: '.' (period), '-' (dash), '\_'(underscore), ' ' (space). 
%You can find examples of version number parsing results in Table \ref{table:exampleVCs}. Also we distinct between numeric version compounds and textual version compound. Numeric version compounds appear in Table \ref{table:exampleVCs} in bold.




\section{Metrics}


In order to analyze degree of version numbers consistency among different software projects, we came up with a set of metrics that measure common features of version numbers sequences. Our script collects metrics by traversing list of version numbers pair by pair. Single value for each metric takes a pair of version numbers [$VN_{1}$, $VN_{2}$] to produce metric value. We collect following metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of increments (by 1) for each numeric version compound. For example, we consider it to be an increment of given numeric version compound for a pair of version numbers if value of numeric version compound changes from 1 to 2 or from 35 to 36, etc.

\begin{equation}
VC_{2} - VC_{1} = 1
\end{equation}

\item Jumps for each numeric version compound. We consider every change in numeric version compound to be a jump if difference between version compound values appear to be greater than 1. Examples: 1 to 3, 5 to 10. 

\begin{equation}
VC_{2} - VC_{1} > 1
\end{equation}

\end{itemize}

We collect length of each jump for further analysis. For example list of jumps for third version compound for array of version numbers [1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.5, 1.0.6, 1.0.7, 1.0.10] would be [2, 3]. 
\begin{itemize}

\item Number of empty jumps for each numeric version compound. We consider change of numeric version compound to be an empty jump if empty value substitutes numeric value of version compound. For example, there is an empty jump of fourth version compound for the pair of version numbers [1.0.2.4, 1.0.3].


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
isNumeric(VC_{1}) \&\& isEmpty(VC_{2})  || \\  isNumeric(VC_{2}) \&\& isEmpty(VC_{1})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\item Number of version placeholders for each numeric version compound. Sometimes version numbering patterns use special characters to represent set of version numbers instead of just one version number. For example, version number 1.x represents set of version numbers [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, $\dots$, 1.N]. As long as we found only one special character that some software projects use as a version placeholder ('x'), we count only for appearances of this character as version compound value. 
\item Instances of Megalomania

\end{itemize}

There are several ways of incrementing version numbers in cases when version numbers consist of more than one version compound. For example developer might think about two ways of incrementing version 1.0 if he or she needs to come up with version for next release. As far as most of the existing conventions describe [LINKS], first way is to assign version 1.1 to new release. Second way is to assign version 2.0. Note that second approach uses increment of first version compound instead of incrementing rightmost version compound. 

We consider this case of assigning next version number (incrementing version compounds on the left side instead of rightmost version compound) to be instance of megalomania. 

In most general case, instances of megalomania include increment of version number than involves increment of other version compounds than the rightmost version compound.

Other examples of megalomania: $$ 1.0.2 \rightarrow 2.0.0 \texttt{, } 1.4.5 \rightarrow 1.5.0 $$

There are N-1 possible cases of assigning new version to the version number with N numeric version compounds. We distinct between different ways of assigning version numbers depending on position of incremented numeric version compound. 

For example we consider change of version 1.0.0.0 to 2.0.0.0 to be megalomania of severity 3, change of version 1.0.4\_p34 to 1.1.0 to be megalomania of severity 2, etc. In most general case, we consider changing 1st numeric version compound in version with N numeric version compounds to be megalomania of severity N-1, 2nd numeric version compound in version with N numeric version compounds to be megalomania of severity N-2, and so on. 

We collect information about megalomania severity as another metric. For example, list of megalomania severities for list of versions [1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 2.0.0] would be [1,1,2].

We calculated metrics both for each version compound and aggregated values to represent metrics for  version number.


\section{Analysis}

\section{Implications}

\section{Threats to Validity}

\par The proprietary data may be incomplete because we only harvested information that the distributor chose to display online which could contribute to additional jumps for artifacts that were never made public. Conversely, enterprises may shield the general from the burden of intermediate builds by only displaying clean, sequential versions on their websites and in their documentation which could skew the results of our analysis.
